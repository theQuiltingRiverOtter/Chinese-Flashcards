# Chinese-Flashcards

This project is a current work in progress. Functionality and design will be added as I learn how to do it. 

MOTIVATION: 
This project is developed to answer a need for a 'three-sided' flashcard for Chinese language learners. Most flashcard applications (and hard-copy flashcards) only have two sides. However, Chinese requires one to learn the characters, pronunciation, and definition for each term. With a two sided flashcard, the pronunciation must be paired with either the characters or the definition. Both methods reduce the opportunity for the language learner to memorize each aspect separately. This flashcard application will be capable of switching between three sides, a Chinese character side, a pronunciation (called pinyin) side, and an English side.

CURRENT FUNCTIONS: 
The script has a built in array of Chinese terms with a nested array for each term that includes the characters, pronunciation, part of speech, and English definition. Clicking on one of the corresponding buttons will trigger a function to display the appropriate aspect in the DOM. Clicking the 'new' button will choose a random term from the array for display. 

What I want it to do: 
I would like to be able to store lists of terms in a back-end database, that the user can pull out as they please. I would like them to be able to add new terms or lists, both through a UI for the application, or by uploading a CSV or excel file. I would like to add functionality to show the part of speech if the user chooses. I would like to add another function to change the color of the pinyin to match the tones if the user chooses. I would like to overhaul the UI for the entire application to make it cleaner, prettier, and more user friendly.
